```

Lets get started.

```{r loading_packages, message=FALSE, warning=TRUE}

# Loading packages required for this script.

library(tidyverse) # Data manipulation.
library(magrittr)  # pipe operators.
library(mlr)       # Machine learning. 

```


```{r loading_data}
# Ingest the dataset. 
customer_data <- read_csv("data/bankchurners.csv")

# Size of the data set.

dim(customer_data)

# A glimpse on the content of our data set.

glimpse(customer_data)

view(customer_data)


```


The data set has 10,000 row and 23 columns. In the next code building sessions we are going to flesh the meat out of this not so large data set and see what insights we can derive from it.
A glimpse into the data tells us of the several variables that are encoded with inappropriate data types and some over variables that prove to add no value in terms of predicting the outcome variable.
